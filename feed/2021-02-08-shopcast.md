Edin Dedagic - host at the German podcast shopcast.fm - invited us to have a talk about HEPTACOM as part of the Shopware community and the guest Joshua Behrens.
It was inevitable to talk as well about HEPTAconnect.
A lot about HEPTAconnect which even results in a split into two parts.

Have a deep dive into two hours of HEPTAconnect knowledge and its creators:
