In the recent past we decided to allow [explorers](https://heptaconnect.io/guides/portal-developer/explorer/) behave like [emitters](https://heptaconnect.io/guides/portal-developer/emitter/) to allow easier processing of inefficient-to-read data sources.
We call this direct emission.
How to prepare your explorer for a direct emission is explained in the [direct emission explorer](https://heptaconnect.io/guides/portal-developer/direct-emission-explorer/) page.
To show the differences in the data flow we introduce a place where you can find multiple scenarios on the new [data flow](https://heptaconnect.io/reference/general-resources/data-flow/) overview.

**Coming soon**:
We are currently setting up an integration guide that holds up our integration knowledge and explains our decisions that you should consider as well.
Stay tuned to let your next project experience the full data transfer expertise.
