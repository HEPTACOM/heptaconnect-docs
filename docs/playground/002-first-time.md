# First time with HEPTAconnect

## Clone your environment

To set up your first HEPTAconnect environment fetch a fresh copy of the HEPTAconnect playground:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/HEPTACOM/heptaconnect-playground
cd heptaconnect-playground
```

Now you have the all the sample code you need for different projects to try out.
Make sure you have the tool `make` ready on your system to run later support scripts.


## Choose an environment

We have environments for different frameworks ready to try out.
See the related "first time with â€¦" pages for the different environments below:
