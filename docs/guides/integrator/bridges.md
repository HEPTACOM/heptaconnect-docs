# Bridges

Bridges are solid building blocks to build connections on.
HEPTAconnect bridges provide the technological ground the core shall be used on.
There are ready-to-use bridges that can be used right away in your integration.


## How to get a bridge?

There are multiple sources for bridges.
Some of them are available as open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/topics/heptaconnect-bridge) and [packagist](https://packagist.org/?tags=heptaconnect%20bridge) like our [Shopware 6 bridge](https://github.com/HEPTACOM/heptaconnect-bridge-shopware-platform).
There are also client specific implementations we (HEPTACOM GmbH) and our HEPTAconnect partners develop as well.

## Shopware 6

The first and most used bridge that ships with a data layer build on top of the Shopware 6 DAL.
It is very useful and easy to integrate as it exposes itself as Shopware bundle that can be easily used as a plugin.
Ship it as bundle in your project or build a self-containing plugin with it and integrate it in your environment of choice.
