# Initialization of a feed

To react to community feedback we will start a feed to summarize every now and then interesting changes in this feed.

This does not replace the [ADR](https://connect.heptacom.de/#/adr/2020-08-10-architecture-decision-records) section at all.
As we have a lot of repositories and this will be a channel to summarize the news that are shared across the packages.
This will also be the way to get informed about new packages as we follow our [flexible package structure](https://connect.heptacom.de/#/general-resources/002-package-structure).
